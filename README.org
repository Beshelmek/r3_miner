** summary
- [[https://github.com/Starkus/quarry][Starkus/quarry]] was chosen as a base for this project since it is the only mining script on github that actually works... it is also nicely written; the algorithm is great and the code is very easy to read, even for someone who does not know lua.
- the last real commit is from 2018, back when charcoal under the hood was just coal with damage applied, while now it is its own object. therefore the script will crash if it tries to look for an item to refuel with, as well as many other bugs that arise from a four-year difference in the minecraft backend.
- this project takes an old (but excellent and working) script and applies a bunch of fixes to work with today's minecraft.
** environment details
- minecraft 1.18.2 (should work fine on 1.19.x)
- [[https://modrinth.com/modpack/eris/version/0.2.1][eris 0.2.1]]
- [[https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched][cc:restitched 1.100.8]]

2. place a chest to the left of the turtle starting point.
3. right-click the turtle, add fuel (coal, charcoal, or lignite coal [[https://github.com/AztechMC/Modern-Industrialization][(modern industrialization)]]
