** summary
[[https://github.com/Starkus/quarry][Starkus/quarry]] was chosen as a base for this project. It is the only script that worked for me, with only few minor adjustments needed to start. The last meaningful commit is from 2018, back when the logic for the coal/charcoal object was much different. This script is likely to work with later versions.
** quick start
1. place a mining turtle on the ground.
  - by default it will dig 16m forward, then turn right, while slowly creating a 16x16m hole, down to bedrock.
2. place a chest to the left of the turtle starting point.
3. right-click the turtle, add fuel (coal, charcoal, or lignite coal [[https://github.com/AztechMC/Modern-Industrialization][(modern industrialization)]]
4. install a [[https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github][github client]]: ~pastebin run p8PJVxC4~
5. download miner: ~github clone Beshelmek/r3_miner -b now .~
6. start miner: ~r3~
